# redux-dusk

redux-dusk makes it easy to integrate [Redux](https://redux.js.org/),
[Redux Logic](https://github.com/jeffbski/redux-logic), and
[Reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect) into your project.
redux-dusk is designed to work best with [React](https://reactjs.org/)
or [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
