redux-dusk is a framework that helps make it easy to integrate [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) into your project. It wraps your Redux logic into **[handlers](handlers)** that can be called upon within your components and pages.

redux-dusk is designed to work best with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

## Inspiration

I was finding it really difficult to wrap my head around Redux and how it worked. One day it just clicked for me, but I found that it seemed a little verbose and prone to errors by having to manually enter types all over the place. I also saw that my teammates were still struggling with learning Redux. I built redux-dusk for that purpose to make it easier to write new apps using Redux and to serve as a teaching tool for my colleagues.

Although some concepts are similar to [reduxsauce](https://github.com/infinitered/reduxsauce), I only learned about that project a few weeks after developing my initial
version of redux-dusk. I like a lot of things reduxsauce does, but I wanted to make it even more flexible and easy, so I rewrote
redux-dusk into what it is today (starting with 0.6.0).
